Enhancing Physical Education in Indonesia: Analyzing Student Textbook Needs in the Era of Merdeka Curriculum

## Overview

This project analyzed the need for student textbooks in Physical Education (PJOK) for elementary, middle, and high school levels in Indonesia under the new Merdeka Curriculum. The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate existing textbooks, identify student preferences, and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Data Details

*   **Source:** Surveys and interviews with students across elementary, middle, and high schools in Indonesia.
*   **Key Variables:** Student perceptions of PJOK textbooks, design preferences, curriculum alignment, accessibility.

## Problem Statement

The implementation of the Merdeka Curriculum requires updated and effective PJOK textbooks that cater to the needs and preferences of modern students. This project aimed to identify gaps in the current provision and usage of PJOK textbooks and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Solution

The study employed a mixed-methods approach:
* Quantitative data from surveys provided insights into student perceptions. 
* Qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) explored student preferences and challenges in more detail.
* ATLAS.ti was used to analyze qualitative data to identify key themes and patterns.
* This multi-faceted approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

## Insight

* Students generally had a positive view of PJOK textbooks, but there were differences across grade levels.
* Visual appeal, including illustrations and graphic design, was a crucial factor for all ages. 
* Content relevance, ease of understanding, and integration with the Merdeka Curriculum were also highlighted. 

## Recommendation

* Textbook design should be tailored to the developmental stage of students, considering their physical, emotional, and cognitive characteristics. 
* Visual elements should be engaging, diverse, and aligned with the Merdeka Curriculum. 
* Accessibility of textbooks, both in print and digital formats, should be ensured for all students.
* Continuous monitoring and evaluation of textbook quality are necessary.
