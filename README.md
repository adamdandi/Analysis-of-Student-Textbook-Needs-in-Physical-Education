Enhancing Physical Education in Indonesia: Analyzing Student Textbook Needs in the Era of Merdeka Curriculum

## Overview

This project analyzed the need for student textbooks in Physical Education (PJOK) for elementary, middle, and high school levels in Indonesia under the new Merdeka Curriculum. The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate existing textbooks, identify student preferences, and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Data Details

*   **Source:** Surveys and interviews with students across elementary, middle, and high schools in Indonesia. [cite: 9]
*   **Key Variables:** Student perceptions of PJOK textbooks, design preferences, curriculum alignment, accessibility.

## Problem Statement

The implementation of the Merdeka Curriculum requires updated and effective PJOK textbooks that cater to the needs and preferences of modern students. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5] This project aimed to identify gaps in the current provision and usage of PJOK textbooks and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Solution

The study employed a mixed-methods approach:
* Quantitative data from surveys provided insights into student perceptions. [cite: 9]
* Qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) explored student preferences and challenges in more detail. [cite: 9, 59]
* Atlas.ti was used to analyze qualitative data to identify key themes and patterns. [cite: 9]
* This multi-faceted approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

## Insight

* Students generally had a positive view of PJOK textbooks, but there were differences across grade levels.
* Visual appeal, including illustrations and graphic design, was a crucial factor for all ages. [cite: 28, 61, 63]
* Content relevance, ease of understanding, and integration with the Merdeka Curriculum were also highlighted. [cite: 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 39, 44, 45, 56, 57, 58]

## Recommendation

* Textbook design should be tailored to the developmental stage of students, considering their physical, emotional, and cognitive characteristics. [cite: 57]
* Visual elements should be engaging, diverse, and aligned with the Merdeka Curriculum. [cite: 58]
* Accessibility of textbooks, both in print and digital formats, should be ensured for all students. [cite: 18, 69]
* Continuous monitoring and evaluation of textbook quality are necessary. [cite: 59]
